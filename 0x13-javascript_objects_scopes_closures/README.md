0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

# Learning Objectives - JavaScript Basics

## General Overview

JavaScript is an incredible programming language known for its versatility and usage in web development, among other things. In this project, we'll cover fundamental concepts and delve into the core aspects of JavaScript.

## Object Creation in JavaScript

JavaScript provides various ways to create objects. Understanding object creation is crucial for managing and organizing data efficiently.

## `this` Keyword

`this` in JavaScript refers to the context in which a function is executed. It's a reference to the object that owns the currently executing code.

## Understanding `undefined`

In JavaScript, `undefined` signifies a variable that has been declared but not assigned any value. It's also the default return value of functions without a return statement.

## Importance of Variable Types and Scope

Variable types and scope are essential concepts in JavaScript. Knowing the type of variable (string, number, etc.) and where it's accessible within code (scope) is crucial for writing bug-free programs.

## Closures

Closures in JavaScript allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing scopes, even after the outer function has finished executing.

## Prototypes and Inheritance

In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through prototypes. Understanding how to create and work with prototypes facilitates code reuse and inheritance.

## Inheriting Objects in JavaScript

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. JavaScript supports prototype-based inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

Throughout this project, we'll explore these concepts, understand their significance, and practice implementing them in JavaScript code.
